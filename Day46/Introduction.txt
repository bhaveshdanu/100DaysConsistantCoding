📌Given a doubly linked list and a position. The task is to delete a node from given position in a doubly linked list.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList = 1 <--> 3 <--> 4 
x = 3
📌📌Output: 1 3  
📌📌Explanation: After deleting the node at
position 3 (position starts from 1),
the linked list will be now as 1->3.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList = 1 <--> 5 <--> 2 <--> 9  
x = 1
📌📌Output: 5 2 9

📌Your Task:
The task is to complete the function deleteNode() which should delete the node at given position and return the head of the linkedlist.

📌Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
📌Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

📌Constraints:
2 <= size of the linked list <= 1000
1 <= x <= N
