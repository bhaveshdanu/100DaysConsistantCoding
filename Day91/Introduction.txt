📌Given a sorted array Arr of size N and a number X, you need to find the number of occurrences of X in Arr.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 7, X = 2
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
📌📌Output: 4
📌📌Explanation: 2 occurs 4 times in the
given array.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 7, X = 4
Arr[] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3}
📌📌Output: 0
📌📌Explanation: 4 is not present in the
given array.

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function count() which takes the array of integers arr, n and x as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 106
1 ≤ X ≤ 106
