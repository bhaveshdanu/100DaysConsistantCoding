📌Given an array A[] of size n. The task is to find the largest element in it.
 

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
n = 5
A[] = {1, 8, 7, 56, 90}
📌📌Output:
90
📌📌Explanation:
The largest element of given array is 90.
 

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
n = 7
A[] = {1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5}
📌📌Output:
5
📌📌Explanation:

📌Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function largest() which takes the array A[] and its size n as inputs and returns the maximum element in the array.

 

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

📌Constraints:
1 <= n<= 103
0 <= A[i] <= 103
Array may contain duplicate elements.
