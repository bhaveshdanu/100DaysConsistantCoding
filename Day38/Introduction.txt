📌Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 6
A[] = {3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167}
📌📌Output:
min = 1, max =  10000
 

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 5
A[]  = {1, 345, 234, 21, 56789}
📌📌Output:
min = 1, max = 56789
 

📌Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function getMinMax() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the minimum and maximum element of the array.

 

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <=1012
