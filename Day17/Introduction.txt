📌Given an array arr[] of N integers, calculate the median
 

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: N = 5
arr[] = 90 100 78 89 67
📌📌Output: 89
📌📌Explanation: After sorting the array 
middle element is the median 

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: N = 4
arr[] = 56 67 30 79
📌📌Output: 61
📌📌Explanation: In case of even number of 
elements, average of two middle elements 
is the median.

 

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function find_median() which takes the array as input parameter and returns the floor value of the median.
 

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(n * log(n))
📌Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

📌Constraints:
1 <= Length of Array <= 100
1 <= Elements of Array <= 100
