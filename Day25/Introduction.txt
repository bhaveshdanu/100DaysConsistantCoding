📌Given a number N. Count the number of digits in N which evenly divides N.

📌Note :- Evenly divides means whether N is divisible by a digit i.e. leaves a remainder 0 when divided.
 

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 12
📌📌Output:
2
📌📌Explanation:
1, 2 both divide 12 evenly

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 23
📌📌Output
0
📌📌Explanation:
2 and 3, none of them
divide 23 evenly

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function evenlyDivides() which takes an integer N as input parameters and returns an integer, total number factor of digits N which divides N evenly.


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
📌Expected Space Complexity: O(1)
 

📌Constraints:
1<=N<=105
