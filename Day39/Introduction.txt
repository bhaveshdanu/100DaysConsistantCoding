📌Given an array Arr of N elements and a integer K. Your task is to return the position of first occurence of K in the given array.
Note: Position of first element is considered as 1.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 5, K = 16
Arr[] = {9, 7, 2, 16, 4}
📌📌Output: 4
📌📌Explanation: K = 16 is found in the
given array at position 4.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 7, K = 98
Arr[] = {1, 22, 57, 47, 34, 18, 66}
Output: -1
📌📌Explanation: K = 98 isn't found in
the given array.
📌📌Your Task:
Complete the function search() which takes an array arr, two integers n and k, as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer. Return -1 if the number is not found in array. You don't to print answer or take inputs.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= K <= 106
1 <= Arr[i] <= 106
