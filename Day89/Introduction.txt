📌Given three distinct numbers A, B and C. Find the number with value in middle (Try to do it with minimum comparisons).


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
A = 978, B = 518, C = 300
📌📌Output:
518
📌📌Explanation:
Since 518>300 and 518<978, so 
518 is the middle element.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
A = 162, B = 934, C = 200
📌📌Output:
200
📌📌Exaplanation:
Since 200>162 && 200<934,
So, 200 is the middle element.

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function middle() which takes three integers A,B and C as input parameters and returns the number which has middle value.


📌Expected Time Complexity:O(1)
📌Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)


📌Constraints:
1<=A,B,C<=109
A,B,C are distinct.
