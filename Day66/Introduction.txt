📌Given an array A containing 2*N+2 positive numbers, out of which 2*N numbers exist in pairs whereas the other two number occur exactly once and are distinct. Find the other two numbers. Return in increasing order.


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: 
N = 2
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4}
📌📌Output:
3 4 
📌📌Explanation:
3 and 4 occur exactly once.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 1
arr[] = {2, 1, 3, 2}
📌vOutput:
1 3
📌📌Explanation:
1 3 occur exactly once.

📌Your Task:
You do not need to read or print anything. Your task is to complete the function singleNumber() which takes the array as input parameter and returns a list of two numbers which occur exactly once in the array. The list must be in ascending order.


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Space Complexity: O(1)


📌Constraints:
1 <= length of array <= 106 
1 <= Elements in array <= 5 * 106
