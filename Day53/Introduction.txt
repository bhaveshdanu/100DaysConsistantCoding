📌Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to reverse this list.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6
📌📌Output: 6 5 4 3 2 1
📌📌Explanation: After reversing the list, 
elements are 6->5->4->3->2->1.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList: 2->7->8->9->10
📌📌Output: 10 9 8 7 2
📌📌Explanation: After reversing the list,
elements are 10->9->8->7->2.

📌Your Task:
The task is to complete the function reverseList() with head reference as the only argument and should return new head after reversing the list.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
