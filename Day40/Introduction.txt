📌Given a Binary Search Tree and a node value X, find if the node with value X is present in the BST or not.


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:          2
                      \
                       81 
                     /    \ 
                   42      87 
                    \       \ 
                     66      90 
                    / 
                  45
X = 87
📌📌Output: 1
📌📌Explanation: As 87 is present in the
given nodes , so the output will be
1.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:      6
                   \ 
                    8 
                   / \ 
                  7   9
X = 11
📌📌Output: 0
📌📌Explanation: As 11 is not present in 
the given nodes , so the output will
be 0.

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function search()which returns true if the node with value x is present in the BSTelse returns false.


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(Height of the BST)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).


📌Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 105
