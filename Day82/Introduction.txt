📌Given two numbers a and b. In one operation you can pick any non negative integer x and either of a or b. Now if you picked a then replace a with a&x else if you picked b then replace b with b&x.

📌Return the minimum number of operation required to make a and b equal.

📌Note: Here & represents bitwise AND operation.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
a = 5, b = 12
📌📌Output:
2
📌📌Explanantion:
In first operation replace 
a = a&4 = 4
after that replace 
b = b&6 = 4
Hence both are same after applying two
operations.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: 
a = 100, b = 100
📌📌Output: 
0
📌📌Explanation: 
Already same.

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read, input, or print anything. Your task is to complete the function solve( ), which takes two integers a and b as input parameters and returns the answer.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
0 ≤ a, b ≤ 109
