📌This is a functional problem. Your task is to return the product of array elements under a given modulo.
The modulo operation finds the remainder after the division of one number by another. For example, K(mod(m))=K%m= remainder obtained when K is divided by m

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
1
4
1 2 3 4

📌📌Output:
24

📌Example 2:
📌📌Input:
The first line of input contains T denoting the number of test cases. Then each of the T lines contains a single positive integer N denotes the number of elements in the array. The next line contains 'N' integer elements of the array.


📌📌Output:
Return the product of array elements under a given modulo.
That is, return (Array[0]*Array[1]*Array[2]...*Array[n])%modulo.

📌Constraints:
1<=T<=200
1<=N<=10^5
1<=ar[i]<=10^5
