📌Given two Singly Linked List of N and M nodes respectively. The task is to check whether two linked lists are identical or not. 
Two Linked Lists are identical when they have same data and with same arrangement too.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5->6
LinkedList2: 99->59->42->20
📌📌Output: Not identical 

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList1: 1->2->3->4->5
LinkedList2: 1->2->3->4->5
📌📌Output: Identical
 
📌Your Task:
The task is to complete the function areIdentical() which takes the head of both linked lists as arguments and returns True or False.

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103

📌Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
📌Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)
