📌Given a random set of numbers, Print them in sorted order.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}
📌📌Output: {1, 2, 3, 5}
📌📌Explanation: After sorting array will 
be like {1, 2, 3, 5}.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 2
arr[] = {3, 1}
📌📌Output: {1, 3}
📌📌Explanation: After sorting array will
be like {1, 3}.

📌Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sortArr() which takes the list of integers and the size N as inputs and returns the modified list.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N * log N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 ≤ N, A[i] ≤ 105
