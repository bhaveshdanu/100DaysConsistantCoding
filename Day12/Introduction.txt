📌Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

📌Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}
📌📌Output: 2
📌📌Explanation: Only Arr[2] = 2 exists here.


📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: 
N = 1
Arr[] = {1}
📌📌Output: 1
📌📌Explanation: Here Arr[1] = 1 exists.


📌Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function valueEqualToIndex() which takes the array of integers arr[] and n as parameters and returns an array of indices where the given conditions are satisfied. When there is no such element exists then return an empty array of length 0.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
 

📌Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 106
