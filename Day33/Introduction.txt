📌Given an array arr[] and an integer K where K is smaller than size of array, the task is to find the Kth smallest element in the given array. It is given that all array elements are distinct.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 6
arr[] = 7 10 4 3 20 15
K = 3
📌📌Output : 7
📌📌Explanation :
3rd smallest element in the given 
array is 7.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 5
arr[] = 7 10 4 20 15
K = 4
📌📌Output : 15
📌📌Explanation :
4th smallest element in the given 
array is 15.

📌Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function kthSmallest() which takes the array arr[], integers l and r denoting the starting and ending index of the array and an integer K as input and returns the Kth smallest element.
 
 
📌Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(log(n))

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <= 105
1 <= K <= N
