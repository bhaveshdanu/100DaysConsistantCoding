📌Given an array Arr of size N, print second largest element from an array.

📌Example 1:

📌Input: 
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
📌Output: 34
📌Explanation: The largest element of the 
array is 35 and the second largest element
is 34.

📌Example 2:

📌Input: 
N = 3
Arr[] = {10, 5, 10}
📌Output: 5
📌Explanation: The largest element of 
the array is 10 and the second 
largest element is 5.


📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function print2largest() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer. If 2nd largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arri ≤ 105
