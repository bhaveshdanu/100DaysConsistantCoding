📌Given an array arr[] sorted in ascending order of size N and an integer K. Check if K is present in the array or not.


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 5, K = 6
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,6}
📌📌Output: 1
📌📌Exlpanation: Since, 6 is present in 
the array at index 4 (0-based indexing),
output is 1.
 

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 5, K = 2
arr[] = {1,3,4,5,6}
📌📌Output: -1
📌📌Exlpanation: Since, 2 is not present 
in the array, output is -1.
 

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function searchInSorted() which takes the sorted array arr[], its size N and the element K as input parameters and returns 1 if K is present in the array, else it returns -1. 


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(Log N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106
1 <= K <= 106
1 <= arr[i] <= 106
