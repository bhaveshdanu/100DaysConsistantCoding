📌Given two arrays a[] and b[] respectively of size n and m, the task is to print the count of elements in the intersection (or common elements) of the two arrays.

📌For this question, the intersection of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements between the two arrays. 

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
n = 5, m = 3
a[] = {89, 24, 75, 11, 23}
b[] = {89, 2, 4}

📌📌Output: 1

📌📌Explanation: 
89 is the only element 
in the intersection of two arrays.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
n = 6, m = 5
a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
b[] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7} 

📌📌Output: 4

📌📌Explanation: 
3 4 5 and 6 are the elements 
in the intersection of two arrays.

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function NumberofElementsInIntersection() which takes two integers n and m and their respective arrays a[] and b[]  as input. The function should return the count of the number of elements in the intersection.

 

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(n + m).
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(min(n,m)).

📌Constraints:
1 ≤ n, m ≤ 105
1 ≤ a[i], b[i] ≤ 105
