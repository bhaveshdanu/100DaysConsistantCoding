📌Swap given two numbers and print them. (Try to do it without a temporary variable.) and return it.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: a = 13, b = 9
📌📌Output: 9 13
📌📌Explanation: after swapping it
becomes 9 and 13.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: a = 15, b = 8
📌📌Output: 8 15
📌📌Explanation: after swapping it
becomes 8 and 15.

📌Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function get() which takes a, b as inputs and returns the list of integers contains the new value of a and b after swap.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
