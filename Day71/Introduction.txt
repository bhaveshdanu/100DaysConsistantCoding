📌Given an array Arr of size N, swap the Kth element from beginning with Kth element from end.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 8, K = 3
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
📌📌Output: 1 2 6 4 5 3 7 8
📌📌Explanation: Kth element from beginning is
3 and from end is 6.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 5, K = 2
Arr[] = {5, 3, 6, 1, 2}
📌📌Output: 5 1 6 3 2
📌📌Explanation: Kth element from beginning is
3 and from end is 1.

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function swapKth() which takes the array of integers arr, n and k as parameters and returns void. You have to modify the array itself.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arr[i] ≤ 103
