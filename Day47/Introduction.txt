📌You are given an integer N. You need to convert all zeroes of N to 5.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 1004
📌📌Output: 1554
📌📌Explanation: There are two zeroes in 1004
on replacing all zeroes with "5", the new
number will be "1554".

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 121
📌📌Output: 121
📌📌Explanation: Since there are no zeroes in
"121", the number remains as "121".
📌Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function convertFive() which takes an integer N as an argument and replaces all zeros in the number N with 5. Your function should return the converted number.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(K) where K is the number of digits in N
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 <= n <= 10000
