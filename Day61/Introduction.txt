📌Given a doubly-linked list, a position p, and an integer x. The task is to add a new node with value x at the position just after pth node in the doubly linked list.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList: 2<->4<->5
p = 2, x = 6 
📌📌Output: 2 4 5 6
📌📌Explanation: p = 2, and x = 6. So, 6 is
inserted after p, i.e, at position 3
(0-based indexing).

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList: 1<->2<->3<->4
p = 0, x = 44
📌📌Output: 1 44 2 3 4
📌📌Explanation: p = 0, and x = 44 . So, 44
is inserted after p, i.e, at position 1
(0-based indexing).

📌Your Task:
The task is to complete the function addNode() which head reference, position and data to be inserted as the arguments, with no return type.

📌Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
📌Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 104
0 <= p < N
