📌Given three integers P,R and T, denoting Principal, Rate of Interest and Time period respectively.Compute the simple Interest.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
P=100
R=20
T=2
📌📌Output:
40.00
📌📌Explanation:
The simple interest on 100 at a rate
of 20% across 2 time periods is 40.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
P=999
R=9
T=9
📌📌Output:
809.19
📌📌Explanation:
The simple interest on 999 at a rate 
of 9% across 9 time periods is 809.19

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your Task is to complete the function simpleInterest() which takes three integers P,R and T and returns the simple interest.


📌Expected Time Complexity:O(1)
📌Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)
 

📌Constraints:
1<=P<=105
1<=R,T<=100
