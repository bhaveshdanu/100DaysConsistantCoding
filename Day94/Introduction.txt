📌Given an array arr[] containing positive elements. A and B are two numbers defining a range. The task is to check if the array contains all elements in the given range.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: N = 7, A = 2, B = 5
arr[] =  {1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 3}
📌📌Output: Yes
📌📌Explanation: It has elements between 
range 2-5 i.e 2,3,4,5

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: N = 7, A = 2, B = 6
arr[] = {1, 4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 3}
📌📌Output: No
📌📌Explanation: Array does not contain 6.

📌Your Task:
This is a function problem. You don't need to take any input, as it is already accomplished by the driver code. You just need to complete the function check_elements() that takes array arr, integer N, integer A, and integer B  as parameters and returns the boolean True if array elements contain all elements in the given range else boolean False.

📌Note: If the array contains all elements in the given range then driver code outputs Yes otherwise, it outputs No

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
