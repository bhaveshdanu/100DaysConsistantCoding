names[] = { "Geek", "Geeks", "Geeksfor",
  "GeeksforGeek", "GeeksforGeeks" }

📌📌Output:

📌Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function longest() which takes the array names[] and its size N as inputs and returns the Longest name in the list of names.


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= |length of name| <= 1000
