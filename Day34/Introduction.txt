📌Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
📌📌Output: 5
📌📌Explanation: Count of nodes in the 
linked list is 5, which is its length.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
📌📌Output: 7
📌📌Explanation: Count of nodes in the
linked list is 7. Hence, the output
is 7.

📌Your Task:
Your task is to complete the given function getCount(), which takes a head reference as an argument and should return the length of the linked list.

📌Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
📌Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= value <= 103
