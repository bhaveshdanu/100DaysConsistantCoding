📌Write a program to find the sum of the given series 1+2+3+ . . . . . .(N terms) 

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 1
📌📌Output: 1
📌📌Explanation: For n = 1, sum will be 1.


📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 5
📌📌Output: 15
📌📌Explanation: For n = 5, sum will be 1
+ 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.

📌Your Task:
Complete the function seriesSum() which takes single integer n, as input parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer. You don't need to print the answer or take inputs.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
