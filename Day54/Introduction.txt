📌Given a singly linked list and an integer x.Delete xth node from the singly linked list.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: 1 -> 3 -> 4 
       x = 3
📌📌Output: 1 -> 3
📌📌Explanation:
After deleting the node at 3rd
position (1-base indexing), the
linked list is as 1 -> 3. 

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 9 
x = 2
📌📌Output: 1 -> 2 -> 9
📌📌Explanation: 
After deleting the node at 2nd
position (1-based indexing), the
linked list is as 1 -> 2 -> 9.
 

📌Your task: Your task is to complete the method deleteNode() which takes two arguments: the address of the head of the linked list and an integer x. The function returns the head of the modified linked list.

📌Constraints:
1 <= T <= 300
2 <= N <= 100
1 <= x <= N
