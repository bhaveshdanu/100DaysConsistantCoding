📌Union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.
📌Given two sorted arrays of size n and m respectively, find their union.


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 3, arr2 [] = {1, 2, 3}
📌📌Output: 1 2 3 4 5
📌📌Explanation: Distinct elements including 
both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.
 

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: 
n = 5, arr1[] = {2, 2, 3, 4, 5}  
m = 5, arr2[] = {1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
📌📌Output: 1 2 3 4 5
📌📌Explanation: Distinct elements including 
both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.
 

📌Example 3:

📌📌Input:
n = 5, arr1[] = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
m = 5, arr2[] = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
📌📌Output: 1 2
📌📌Explanation: Distinct elements including 
both the arrays are: 1 2.

📌Your Task: 
You do not need to read input or print anything. Complete the function findUnion() that takes two arrays arr1[], arr2[], and their size n and m as input parameters and returns a list containing the union of the two arrays. 
 

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(n+m).
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n+m).
 

📌Constraints:
1 <= n, m <= 105
1 <= arr[i], brr[i] <= 106
