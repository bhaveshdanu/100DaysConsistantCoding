📌Given three integers  'A' denoting the first term of an arithmetic sequence , 'C' denoting the common difference of an arithmetic sequence and an integer 'B'. you need to tell whether 'B' exists in the arithmetic sequence or not. Return 1 if B is present in the sequence. Otherwise, returns 0.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: A = 1, B = 3, C = 2
📌📌Output: 1
📌📌Explaination: 3 is the second term of the 
sequence starting with 1 and having a common 
difference 2.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3
📌📌Output: 0
📌📌Explaination: 2 is not present in the sequence.

📌Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function inSequence() which takes A, B and C and returns 1 if B is present in the sequence. Otherwise, returns 0.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
-109 ≤ A, B, C ≤ 109
