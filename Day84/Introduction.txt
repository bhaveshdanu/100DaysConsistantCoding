📌Given a non null integer matrix Grid of dimensions NxM.Calculate the sum of its elements.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N=2,M=3
Grid=
[[1,0,1],
[-8,9,-2]]
📌📌Output:
1
📌📌Explanation:
The sum of all elements of the matrix is 
(1+0+1-8+9-2)=1.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N=3,M=5
Grid=
[[1,0,1,0,1],
[0,1,0,1,0],
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]]
📌📌Output:
0
📌📌Explanation:
The sum of all elements of the matrix are
(1+0+1+0+1+0+1+0+1+0-1-1-1-1-1)=0.


📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything.Your task is to complete the function sumOfMatrix() which takes two integers N ,M and a 2D array Grid as input parameters and returns the sum of all the elements of the Grid.


📌Expected Time Complexity:O(N*M)
📌Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)


📌Constraints:
1<=N,M<=1000
-1000<=Grid[i][j]<=1000
