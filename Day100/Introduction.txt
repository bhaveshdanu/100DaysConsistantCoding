📌Given a singly linked list of size N of integers. The task is to check if the given linked list is palindrome or not.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,2,1}
📌📌Output: 1
📌📌Explanation: The given linked list is
1 2 1 , which is a palindrome and
Hence, the output is 1.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,2,3,4}
📌📌Output: 0
📌📌Explanation: The given linked list
is 1 2 3 4 , which is not a palindrome
and Hence, the output is 0.

📌Your Task:
The task is to complete the function isPalindrome() which takes head as reference as the only parameter and returns true or false if linked list is palindrome or not respectively.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxialliary Space Usage: O(1)  (ie, you should not use the recursive stack space as well)

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
