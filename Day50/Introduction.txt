📌Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: 
N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
📌📌Output:
0 0 1 2 2
📌📌Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: 
N = 3
arr[] = {0 1 0}
📌📌Output:
0 0 1
📌📌Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated 
into ascending order.

📌Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function sort012() that takes an array arr and N as input parameters and sorts the array in-place.


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^6
0 <= A[i] <= 2
