📌Given a linked list of N nodes. The task is to check if the linked list has a loop. Linked list can contain self loop.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 3
value[] = {1,3,4}
x(position at which tail is connected) = 2
📌📌Output: True
📌📌Explanation: In above test case N = 3.
The linked list with nodes N = 3 is
given. Then value of x=2 is given which
means last node is connected with xth
node of linked list. Therefore, there
exists a loop.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 4
value[] = {1,8,3,4}
x = 0
📌📌Output: False
📌📌Explanation: For N = 4 ,x = 0 means
then lastNode->next = NULL, then
the Linked list does not contains
any loop.

📌Your Task:
The task is to complete the function detectloop() which contains reference to the head as only argument.  This function should return true if linked list contains loop, else return false.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 104
1 ≤ Data on Node ≤ 103
