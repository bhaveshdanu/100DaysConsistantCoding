📌Given two positive integers A and B, find GCD of A and B.


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: A = 3, B = 6
📌📌Output: 3
📌📌Explanation: GCD of 3 and 6 is 3

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input: A = 1, B = 1
📌📌Output: 1
📌📌Explanation: GCD of 1 and 1 is 1

📌Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function gcd() which takes two positive integers as input parameters and returns an integer.


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(A, B)))
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


📌Constraints:
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 109
