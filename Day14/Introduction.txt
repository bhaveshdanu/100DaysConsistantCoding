📌You are given an array A of size N. You need to print elements of A in alternate order (starting from index 0).

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 4
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4}
📌📌Output:
1 3

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
📌📌Output:
1 3 5

📌Your Task:
Since this is a function problem, you just need to complete the provided function print() which takes A and n as input parameters and print the resultant array in the function itself. You have to print the final number of array ending with a space as Printing of newline character is taken care in driver code itself.

📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Ai <= 105

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
