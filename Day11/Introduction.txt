📌Print numbers from 1 to N without the help of loops.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 10
📌📌Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 5
📌📌Output: 1 2 3 4 5
 

📌Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function printNos() that takes N as parameter and prints number from 1 to N recursively. Don't print newline, it will be added by the driver code.


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N) (Recursive).


📌Constraints:
1 <= N <= 1000
