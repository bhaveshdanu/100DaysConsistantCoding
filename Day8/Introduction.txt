📌Given an unsorted array of size N, use selection sort to sort arr[] in increasing order.


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
	N = 5
	arr[] = {4, 1, 3, 9, 7}
📌📌Output:
	1 3 4 7 9

📌Explanation:
	Maintain sorted (in bold) and unsorted subarrays.
	Select 1. Array becomes 1 4 3 9 7.
	Select 3. Array becomes 1 3 4 9 7.
	Select 4. Array becomes 1 3 4 9 7.
	Select 7. Array becomes 1 3 4 7 9.
	Select 9. Array becomes 1 3 4 7 9.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:	
	N = 10
	arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
📌📌Output:
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

📌Your Task:  
	You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the functions select() and selectionSort() ,where select() takes arr[] and starting point of unsorted array i as input parameters and returns the selected element for each iteration in selection sort, and selectionSort() takes the array and it's size and sorts the array.


📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N2)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


📌Constraints:
	1 ≤ N ≤ 10^3
