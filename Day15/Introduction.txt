📌Given a Integer array A[] of n elements. Your task is to complete the function PalinArray. Which will return 1 if all the elements of the Array are palindrome otherwise it will return 0.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
5
111 222 333 444 555

📌📌Output:
1

📌📌Explanation:
A[0] = 111 //which is a palindrome number.
A[1] = 222 //which is a palindrome number.
A[2] = 333 //which is a palindrome number.
A[3] = 444 //which is a palindrome number.
A[4] = 555 //which is a palindrome number.
As all numbers are palindrome so This will return 1.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
3
121 131 20
 
📌📌Output:
0

📌📌Explanation:
20 is not a palindrome hence the output is 0.

📌Constraints:
1 <=T<= 50
1 <=n<= 20
1 <=A[]<= 10000
