📌Given an array of distinct elements. Find the third largest element in it.

📌Suppose you have A[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, its output will be 5 because it is the 3 largest element in the array A.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 5
A[] = {2,4,1,3,5}
📌📌Output: 3

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 2
A[] = {10,2}
📌📌Output: -1

📌Your Task:
Complete the function thirdLargest() which takes the array a[] and the size of the array, n, as input parameters and returns the third largest element in the array. It return -1 if there are less than 3 elements in the given array.

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

📌Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 105
