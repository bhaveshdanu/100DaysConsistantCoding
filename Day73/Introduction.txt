📌Print the multiplication table of a given number N. 


📌Example 1:

📌📌Input:
N = 9

📌📌Output:
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90

📌📌Explanation:
The table of 9 is the output whose 1st 
term is 9 and the 10th term is 90.

📌Example 2:

📌📌Input:
N = 2

📌📌Output:
2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20


📌Your Task:  
You don't need to read input. Your task is to complete the function getTable() which takes an integer N as input parameter and returns a list of integers denoting the multiplication of table of N from 1 to 10. 

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


📌Constraints: 
1 <= N <= 106
