📌Given a String S , print the reverse of the string as output.

📌Example 1:

📌📌Input: S = "GeeksforGeeks"
📌📌Output: "skeeGrofskeeG" 
📌📌Explanation: Element at first is at last and
last is at first, second is at second last and 
second last is at second position and so on .

📌Example 2:

📌Input: S = "ReversE"
📌Output: "EsreveR"
📌Explanation: "E" at first and "R" at last and
"e" at second last and "s" at second and
so on .

📌Your Task:  
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function revStr() which takes S as input parameter and returns the reversed string .

📌Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
📌Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|)

📌Constraints:
1<= |S| <=1000
